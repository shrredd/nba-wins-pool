# NBA Wins Pool
Back in 2012, Bill Simmons came up with the idea for an NFL Wins Pool. Check out Bill's [article](https://grantland.com/the-triangle/you-should-have-an-nfl-wins-pool/) for the basic idea. My friend [John](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-jessen-8a2b601a/) and I wanted to make this happen for the NBA. @John made an iPhone app. This repository is the draft order logic that it pulls from.
